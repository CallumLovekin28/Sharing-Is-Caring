<!-- <p>My name is Callum Lovekin and I am University student currently studying Web Media at Ravensbourne. The site you are currently
on was developed and created by my own two hands, its soul purpose is to raise awareness of teenage mental Health and the steps
you can take if you are going through a hard time or someone you know is. I will also be sharing my own story and what I have
been going through in the past years. Resources are free and avaliable at the bottom of the site
so feel free to use them for advice!</p> -->
