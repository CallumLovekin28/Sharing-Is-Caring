    <h1 id="name"> My name is Callum and I have Derealization.</h1>

    <p>My journey with mental health is still an ongoing one, and finding techniques and routines that can help me feel mentally more healthy
      is something I look at everyday. I have Derealization and essentially what that means is nothing feels real to me.</p>
      <h3><i>What? What do you mean nothing feels real? Explain it?</i></h3>
      <p>I get that question every time someone asks me and there isnt really a way I can describe what it feels like... Well atleast in a way
      where people will understand.</p> <br>

on was developed and created by my own two hands, its soul purpose is to raise awareness of teenage mental Health and the steps
you can take if you are going through a hard time or someone you know is. I will also be sharing my own story and what I have
been going through in the past years. Resources are free and avaliable at the bottom of the site
so feel free to use them for advice!</p> -->
